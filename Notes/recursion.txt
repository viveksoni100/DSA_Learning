What is recursion?
- a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself
- such problems can be solved by an iteration as well

Why do we need a recursion?
- recursive code is easier to write than iterative one
- it is used in many popular algorithms such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithm etc.
- it is used in tree and graph programs

When to choose recursion?
- if we can divide a problem into smaller subproblems
- smaller subproblems should be similar

Properties of a recursive method
- exit condition from loop
- should be calling itself
